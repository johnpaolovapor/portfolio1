                <h2>Dr. Jose Rizal</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Dr. Jose Rizal was a Filipino polymath, nationalist, and the foremost advocate for reforms in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial era. He was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines and died on December 30, 1896, in Manila, Philippines.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Rizal's life and works have made him a national hero in the Philippines. He is remembered and celebrated every year on Rizal Day, which falls on December 30th, the anniversary of his execution.</p>
